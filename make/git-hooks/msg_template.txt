# Before  committing, ensure your code is properly formatted
# you can do that using:

# you can format only flight or ground side code using respectively 
# uncrustify_flight or uncrustify_ground
#
# Each commit needs to have a message like the following sample:
#  OP-1150 UI for thermal calibration: Connect State machine to UI
#
# It needs to begin with a reference to one or more Jira tickets followed by a short description.
# If needed add a longer description in the following lines, after an empty line.
#
# To automatically create a review, append the following smart commit messages:
#   +review OPReview
#
# To append the commit to an existing review, use the following smart commit message:
#   +review OPReview-NNN
# Where NNN is the id of the review i.e. "+review OPReview-609"  
# *NOTE* insert smart commit messages leaving an empty line from the previous text
# starting immediately at first column
