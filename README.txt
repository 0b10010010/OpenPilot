This is an initial release of a CopterControl port to the PS Move controller.
It is still highly experimental:
- you have to redo all your settings and calibrations before EVERY flight 
  (no save feature)
- you need a development environment (at least OpenOCD and a JTAG interface)
- you have to do solderwork to the Move's PCB (voids warranty of course)

Please be extra careful when trying this branch because it has not been very 
well tested.

Have fun
