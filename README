While OpenPilot master source is still in subversion, you cannot "git push" any
changes to the master branch or any other branches tracked by subversion.
Instead these changes need to be committed to SVN via "git svn dcommit".

For that to work you need two things:

1. Your git repository needs to have a git-svn link. You can create that
   manually by adding the following lines into your .git/config file:

[svn-remote "svn"]
        url = svn://svn.openpilot.org/OpenPilot
        fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/trunk
        branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/*
        tags = tags/*:refs/remotes/tags/*

2. Your git repository needs to know the corresponding svn revisions for all
   refs. For that you would execute

git svn fetch --all --use-log-author --add-author-from

   However this takes very long when done the first time. You can speed this up
   by copying the "git/svn" and "git/refs" subfolders into your .git directory,
   which will give you recent subversion references.

   If you have a bash interpreter, executing

./link_to_subversion.sh

   will do this automatically.

   If 'git svn' complains about inconsistencies when trying to dcommit it
   usually helps to do a

git svn rebase

   in your working branch. You can then commit your changes with

git svn dcommit

   which will also automatically push them to the origin git repository.
