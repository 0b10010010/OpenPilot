Features
------------------------------------
- segments
- multimap
- True Active Search: search depending on ellipse area.
- feature appearance prediction <- DONE
- Adapt ActiveSearchGrid and QuickHarrisDetector to the new ROI specifications in module image

- factories <- DONE FOR OBS ONLY
- sensors hardware <- DONE FOR PIN-HOLE firewire 1394

- Map management:
	- Lmk reparametrization:
		- linearity test in OBS.
		- heuristic for lmk reparametrization in Lmk
	- Lmk deletion : 
		- events collected in Obs.
		- heuristic for feature deletion in Lmk
		- deletion in Map, of Lmk and Obs.

Organization
------------------------------------
- move QuickHarrisDetector to fdetect: attention to the prototype of detectIn() !!!
- move ExtendedKalmanFilterIndirect to filter
- move Gaussian to jmath



Performance
------------------------------------
- zncc that can use integral image
- check algorithm speed <- Good 30Hz. See issues with RT and OS
- find a more clever way to manipulate the map used space: ia_indirectArray() is possibly an expensive way to go.
