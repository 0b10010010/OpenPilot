Features
------------------------------------
- segments
- multimap
- True Active Search: search depending on ellipse area.
- feature appearance prediction <- DONE
- Adapt ActiveSearchGrid and QuickHarrisDetector to the new ROI specifications in module image

- factories 		<- DONE FOR OBS ONLY
- sensors hardware 	<- DONE FOR PIN-HOLE firewire 1394

- Map management:
	- use a loop
	- Lmk reparametrization:
		- linearity test in OBS.
		- heuristic for lmk reparametrization in Lmk
	- Lmk deletion :
		- non-reparametrized die when out of view in initializer sensor. 
		- events already collected in Obs.
		- heuristic for feature deletion in Lmk
		- deletion in Map, of Lmk and Obs.

Organization
------------------------------------
- move QuickHarrisDetector to fdetect: attention to the prototype of detectIn() !!!
- move ExtendedKalmanFilterIndirect to filter
- move Gaussian to jmath



Performance
------------------------------------
- zncc that can use integral image
- zncc uses a real ellipse roi (mahalanobis dist)
- check algorithm speed <- Good 30Hz. See issues with RT and OS
- find a more clever way to manipulate the map used space: ia_indirectArray() is possibly an expensive way to go.



Precision
------------------------------------
- when a point is detected, do a matching with itself with interpolation to find subpixel position
