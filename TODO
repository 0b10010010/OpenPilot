Features
------------------------------------
- segments
- multimap
- Adapt ActiveSearchGrid and QuickHarrisDetector to the new ROI specifications in module image

- estimation hardware <- IN PROGRESS FOR MTI


Organization
------------------------------------
- move QuickHarrisDetector to fdetect: attention to the prototype of detectIn() !!!
- move ExtendedKalmanFilterIndirect to filter
- move Gaussian to jmath



Performance
------------------------------------
- zncc optimizations :
	1. use integral images in explorer -> ok
	2. test when partial correlation has been done if it is still possible to reach the goal score -> ok
	3. work first with half resolution images (small investment at first, but 16 times faster then) -> ok
	4. use a real ellipse roi (mahalanobis dist) -> ok
	5. progressively enable optimizations when search area are larger -> ok
	6. start testing with a roi shrinked by 2, then the rest, it should speed up the process because in general the result is close to the center and thanks to 2.
	7. try to copy the search area in another image for a better use of cache
	8. try to use cpu vectorialization (compute 4 zncc at once)
- check algorithm speed <- Good 60Hz. See issues with RT and OS -> reboot and stop the most possible programs and services
- find a more clever way to manipulate the map used space: ia_indirectArray() is possibly an expensive way to go, or maybe use eigen2 instead of ublas...



Precision
------------------------------------
- Finish implementing 1 point Ransac to avoid outliers
- Finish implementing RobotCentric Kalman
- To investigate : predict, compute jacobians, correct mean offline, recompute jacobians, correct online = better consistence but how much more computations ?

- test predicted patch variance: if too low, discard exploration and declare not matched.
- when a point is detected, do a matching with itself with interpolation to find subpixel position
- when a point is matched, try to estimate if there is a possible ambiguity with another point in the ellipse 

Display
------------------------------------

- Allow exhaustive rendering when offline, for videos
- Catch keyboard and mouse events in the windows, in order to allow to play/pause/next...
- Implement double color labels for better visibility on light and dark backgrounds
