Features
------------------------------------
- segments
- multimap
- True Active Search: search depending on ellipse area.
- feature appearance prediction <- DONE
- Adapt ActiveSearchGrid and QuickHarrisDetector to the new ROI specifications in module image

- factories 		<- DONE FOR OBS ONLY
- sensors hardware 	<- DONE FOR PIN-HOLE firewire 1394
- estimation hardware <- IN PROGRESS FOR MTI

- Map management:
	- use a loop
	- Lmk reparametrization:
		- linearity test in OBS.
		- heuristic for lmk reparametrization in Lmk
	- Lmk deletion :
		- non-reparametrized die when out of view in initializer sensor. 
		- events already collected in Obs.
		- heuristic for feature deletion in Lmk
		- deletion in Map, of Lmk and Obs.

Organization
------------------------------------
- move QuickHarrisDetector to fdetect: attention to the prototype of detectIn() !!!
- move ExtendedKalmanFilterIndirect to filter
- move Gaussian to jmath



Performance
------------------------------------
- zncc optimizations :
	1. use integral images in explorer -> ok
	2. test when partial correlation has been done if it is still possible to reach the goal score -> ok
	3. work first with half resolution images (small investment at first, but 16 times faster then) -> ok
	4. use a real ellipse roi (mahalanobis dist) -> ok
	5. progressively enable optimizations when search area are larger -> ok
	6. start testing with a roi shrinked by 2, then the rest, it should speed up the process because in general the result is close to the center and thanks to 2.
	7. try to copy the search area in another image for a better use of cache
	8. try to use cpu vectorialization (compute 4 zncc at once)
- check algorithm speed <- Good 60Hz. See issues with RT and OS
- find a more clever way to manipulate the map used space: ia_indirectArray() is possibly an expensive way to go.



Precision
------------------------------------
- when a point is detected, do a matching with itself with interpolation to find subpixel position
- when a point is matched, try to estimate if there is a possible ambiguity with another point in the ellipse
