Features
------------------------------------
- segments
- multimap
- True Active Search: search depending on ellipse area.
- feature appearance prediction
- Adapt ActiveSearchGrid and QuickHarrisDetector to the new ROI specifications in module image


Organization
------------------------------------
- move QuickHarrisDetector to fdetect: attention to the prototype of detectIn() !!!
- move ExtendedKalmanFilterIndirect to filter
- move Gaussian to jmath



Performance
------------------------------------
- zncc that can use integral image
- check algorithm speed
- find a more clever way to manipulate the map used space: ia_indirectArray() is possibly an expensive way to go.
